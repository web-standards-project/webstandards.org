		<description>@Textlinktausch: On the one hand I agree with you. Following the 80/20-principle it is just ineffektive to test your site on every single pee-browser. The problem here is, that the government has to ensure accessibility. So the question is where to draw the line.</description>

		<description>I ask, should tax payers be asked waste their time upgrading browsers because government departments donâ€™t do Yahoo-style graded browser support?

    When the government assess the cost of testing websites across multiple browers (and govâ€™t websites arenâ€™t usually that complicated, more bloated) then how about they check how much tax theyâ€™re getting off the community to provide the services expected of them? I think that is the missing part of this conversation. Government arenâ€™t just providing websites gratuitously

    Iâ€™ve only had a quick look at the document so far, but my first impressions are that it does a reasonable job of explaining why itâ€™s important to test in browsers, and setting a standard for which browsers Government sites should be tested in. What seems to me to be missing is the â€œcode to standards firstâ€ and â€œgraceful degradationâ€ philosophies, so that any (new or old) browsers that have sufficient standards support should get a usable website even if they havenâ€™t been explicitly tested.</description>

		<description>It is hard to believe that a government is not demanding from its suppliers that the websites should conform to open webstandards, to ensure that every citizen should be ablt to at least navigate through the content delivered by its government.It is seldom cost-efficient to make adaptations for these browsers or to supply special versions of content for them.</description>

		<description>User security should be tested at the same time as &quot;functionality&quot;.  Not whether particular browsers are more secure than another - but whether the browsers used by the public (whatever they may be) can be used to damage the user, their privacy, their system or their data when accessing a particular public sector web site.  Older is not necessarily less, or more, secure - just different.</description>

I&#039;ve published the formal &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/response-browser-standards-consultation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Opera response to the guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which argue that they 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are anti-competitive, as they perpetuate dominance in the browser market by giving the impression that alternative browser products are inferior, and those who choose to use them are not worthy of consideration,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inconvenience users unnecessarily by asking them to install new software,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do not promote best practice development and may lead to more expensive development and testing,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;are too fragmented,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;insufficiently â€œfuture-proofâ€ Web sites, by ignoring methodologies which would ensure compatibility with mobile phones and other devices,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;ignore plug-ins which have capabilities independent of browsers, and&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;do not sufficiently ensure accessibility by disabled users.&lt;/li&gt;
